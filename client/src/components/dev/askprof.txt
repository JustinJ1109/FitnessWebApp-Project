how to use sessions across multiple routing pages

is session data only used server side?

What if you need to GET a users info for certain client side actions?

Hypothetical:

I click on a day to get data for that day

How do I retrieve that day's data specific to the auth'd user?

fetch(/records/2022-11-20) -> use session to get whos currently logged in and auto find those?
